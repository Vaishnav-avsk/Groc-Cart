# Groc Cart

Author: Vaishnav Sai Krishna

This is a simple e-commerce application built with Angular, Firebase and Bootstrap 4. To view the Groc Cart end result (recorded on my local), check the .mov files in this repo.

## Features

This is an Angular project with:

- [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/database/) (implemented with [angularfire2](https://github.com/angular/angularfire2))
- [Bootsrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) (implemented with [NG Bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/))
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [Angular 5 data table](https://github.com/ggmod/angular-5-data-table)
- [RxJS](http://reactivex.io/)

## Running the application

To who so ever who is trying to run this project: After creating the Firebase project with the JSON provided and configuring the application with your custom settings, run `ng serve` to start a development server after you install the node packages. Navigate to `localhost:4200` to see the app running. (Note: Once you download the code zip into your local, you can delete the .mov files - the demo videos of the application)
